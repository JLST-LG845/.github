# Juleast's LG 845 Project
Hi, I'm Juleast.

This is a collection of device trees that I work on for LG devices with the SDM845 chipset.  
Do note, I am in no way an expert and I've only taken existing trees to adapt to certain changes that are required.

For building, check out the [local manifest]().

PRs are welcome!  
Thanks for stopping by.
