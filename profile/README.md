# Juleast's LG 845 Project
Hi, I'm Juleast.

This is a collection of device trees that I work on for LG devices with the SDM845 chipset.  
Do note that I am no expert and have only taken existing trees to adapt to certain required changes.

For building, check out the [local manifest](https://github.com/JLST-LG845/local_manifests).

PRs are welcome!  
Thanks for stopping by.
